1. To use the program, first thing to do is connect the PC and Android device to same network (that means you can ping PC from Android device and ping Android device from PC)

2. Run "MainForm.Java" in src folder. Then open the Android app, choose the PC name in "Avaiable Devices" to begin control the PC.
